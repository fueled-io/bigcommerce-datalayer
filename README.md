# BigCommerce GA4 Ecommerce dataLayer

A dataLayer implementation for BigCommerce, based upon the [Google Analytics 4 Ecommerce specification](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce).

Brought to you by [Fueled Inc](https://fueled.io).

## Overview

dataLayers provide a uniformed way for tracking and attribution scripts, such as Segment's Analytics.js library, to interact with your BigCommerce site. Implementing a dataLayer will ensure that all scripts use consistent attribution values and calculations. They can also cut down on custom code. Finally, they are exposed to Google Tag Manager, if you choose to implement tracking via GTM.

This dataLayer project implements Google's _"Google Analytics v4 Ecommerce Event Specification"_, as described in the following docs:

* https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce
* https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4

## Customization

This script has been designed to work with HTML elements generated by BigCommerce's default theme, Cornerstone. It can be extended to work with custom themes, as well as legacy Blueprint themes, to track additional client interactions.

To modify the selectors the script watches for you can make those changes starting on `line 86` of `./src/index.js`

    var  productDetailsButton = document.getElementsByClassName('card-figure__link') || []; //Product card selector  
    var  mainPageAddButton = document.querySelectorAll("[data-button-type='add-cart']") || []; //Add to cart button selector
    var  productPageAddButton = document.getElementById('form-action-addToCart'); //Add to cart form selector
    var  cartPageRemoveButton = document.getElementsByClassName('cart-remove') || []; //Remove from cart button selector
    var  cartButton = document.getElementsByClassName('navUser-item--cart') || []; //Show Cart selector

Once your customizations are made you can follow the build/installation instructions.
