# BigCommerce dataLayer

A dataLayer implementation for BigCommerce, provided by [Fueled Inc](https://fueled.io).

## Overview

dataLayers provide a uniformed way for tracking and attribution scripts, such as Segment's Analatics.js library, to interact with your BigCommerce site. Implementing a dataLayer will ensure that all scripts use consistent attribution values and calculations. They can also cut down on custom code. Finally, they are exposed to Google Tag Manager, if you choose to implement tracking via GTM.

## Installation

This project is installed via [BigCommerce's Script Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-Script-Manager). The script should be loaded on all pages.

##

_Script variable definitions coming soon._

## Customization

This script has been designed to work with HTML elements generated by BigCommerce's default theme, Cornerstone. It can be extended to work with custom themes, to track additional client interactions. _More on this soon._

## Need Support?

As an open source project, this solution is provided _as is_, without warranty or a commitment to customer support. That said, we are committed to the BigCommerce community and will do our best to answer questions and help you leverage this dataLayer. If you have questions, please feel free to email hello@fueled.io.
