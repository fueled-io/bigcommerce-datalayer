# BigCommerce GA4 Ecommerce dataLayer

A dataLayer implementation for BigCommerce, based upon the [Google Analytics 4 Ecommerce specification](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce).

Brought to you by [Fueled Inc](https://fueled.io).

## Overview

dataLayers provide a uniformed way for tracking and attribution scripts, such as Segment's Analatics.js library, to interact with your BigCommerce site. Implementing a dataLayer will ensure that all scripts use consistent attribution values and calculations. They can also cut down on custom code. Finally, they are exposed to Google Tag Manager, if you choose to implement tracking via GTM.

This dataLayer project implements Google's _"Google Analytics v4 Ecommerce Event Specification"_, as described in the following docs:

* https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce
* https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4

## Installation

This project is installed via [BigCommerce's Script Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-Script-Manager). The script should be loaded on all pages. _(More detailed installation instructions coming soon.)_

## Build

To build and bundle the dataLayer from source, run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm run build`

## Definitions

_Script variable definitions coming soon._

## Customization

This script has been designed to work with HTML elements generated by BigCommerce's default theme, Cornerstone. It can be extended to work with custom themes, as well as legacy Blueprint themes, to track additional client interactions. _(More on this soon.)_
